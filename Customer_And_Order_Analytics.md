## ‚ú®In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data‚ú®

### 1. How many orders were placed in January?
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
```
In this query we're filtering out all of the blank and incorrect orderIDs. 


### 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = "iPhone" 
AND length(orderid) = 6;
```
